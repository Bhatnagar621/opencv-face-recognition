# opencv-face-recognition
## This is a facial recognition program made with the help of openCV.
#### The face-train.py file, trains the machine how different people look and their identities. We can also add a face to the trained faces using the webcam, and then manually enter the persons name.
#### The test data, for faces-train.py file, should be facial images of people, stored in a folder that is named aftar that person (or a suitable label you wish to see) in an `images` folder
#### The faces.py file then uses the web-camera and reads the faces in front of it and identifies the person from the trained faces.
#### This program does not give completely accurate results because the test data is limited, but I will work on it and try to make a better and reliable project out of this.
## This is just a beginner's project to facial recognition.

Help was taken from [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWEHue8kksIaktO8KTTN_zg) youtube channel.  It is a very helpful channel for a beginner in openCV and other python related projects.
